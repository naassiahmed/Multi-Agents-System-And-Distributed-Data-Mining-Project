# Multi-Agents-System-And-Distributed-Data-Mining-Project
A Multi Agents System And Distributed Data Mining Project using JADE and WEKA

The need to treat biggest data collections pushes us to use a technology that can handle this
kind of datasets.
The batch process for data mining consumes a lot of time and resources, and takes a risk for
an anytime crush, in this case the train process may stop at any moment, and the whole
operation may fail and shut down.
This project presents a study of a Multi-Agents System, and distributed Data Mining System,
as well as, techniques to combine these two technologies, in a purpose of building accurate
and transparent models.
In our case, we developed an experimental platform NGB Platform in knowledge extraction
for huge datasets, also we performed a series of datasets, well known as a data benchmark
from UCI (University Of California, Irvine), and we did distribute data and tasks over a
personalized network.
In addition, of treating big datasets and build a strong model in a very reasonable time, we
proposed Neural Networks and Genetics algorithms for combining many classifiers, and we
compared the results to universal ensemble methods such as Boosting, Bagging, Stacking and
Majority voting.
